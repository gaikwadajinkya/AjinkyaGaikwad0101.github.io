I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in the **G²OAT (Graphs, Geometry, Optimization, Algorithms, and Topology) Group** at the  
**Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU Prague)**.

My research interests lie broadly in the field of **graph algorithms, parameterized complexity, and structural graph theory**. 

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in **Theoretical Computer Science** at the  
**Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune**, under the supervision of **Dr. Soumen Maity**.  
During my Ph.D., I explored a variety of graph modification and deletion problems with applications in  
network design, clustering, and data analysis.
